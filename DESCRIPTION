Description: This package contains functions for computing the prices of 
  different types of temperature derivatives based on their measurement periods 
  and underlying locations, and for calibrating the risk-neutral parameters 
  based on the market prices. The prices of the temperature derivatives can be 
  computed using three different methods, including the truncated Fourier 
  series method, the adaptive bandwidth method and multivariate non-Gaussian 
  spatio-temporal models. The temperature forecasts can also be computed using 
  any of the three methods. Since the computations mainly revolve around 
  temperatures data, the average daily temperatures and the deseasonalized 
  temperatures at various measuring stations are provided, and there are also 
  functions to perform simple diagnostic tests on the temperatures data. In 
  addition, there are functions to compute hedge ratios and optimal portfolio 
  weights, which can lead to effective strategies for managing the temperature 
  risks at different locations.
