# Function that returns the price of a temperature futures using the truncated Fourier series method
# temp = n by p matrix containing the past temperatures data at p stations over (n / 365) years
# station = the specific station that the price of the temperature futures depends on
# start_ind = index of the start of the measurement period
# end_ind = index of the end of the measurement period
# type = type of the temperature futures, CDD, HDD or CAT
Fourier = function(temp, station, start_ind, end_ind, type) {
